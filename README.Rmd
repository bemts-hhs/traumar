Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) and Process Improvement (PI) are essential
pillars of healthcare, particularly in the care of injured patients. However,
hospitals, trauma systems, and their trauma program managers (TPMs) often lack
access to standardized quality measures derived from academic literature. The
{traumar} package addresses this gap by providing tools to calculate quality
measures related to relative mortality efficiently and accurately. By automating
these calculations, {traumar} empowers hospital systems, trauma networks, and
TPMs to focus their efforts on analyzing outcomes and driving meaningful
improvements in patient care. Whether you're seeking to enhance PI initiatives
or streamline CQI processes, {traumar} serves as a valuable resource for
advancing trauma care quality.

## Installation

You can install the development version of traumar from [GitHub](https://github.com/bemts-hhs/traumar) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bemts-hhs/traumar")
```

## Calculating the W-Score

The W-Score tells us how many survivals (or deaths) on average out of every 100 cases seen in a trauma center.  Using R, we can do this with the {traumar} package.

### First, we will create the data for these examples

```{r all_data}

# Generate example data with high negative skewness
set.seed(123)

# Parameters
n_patients <- 10000  # Total number of patients

# Generate survival probabilities (Ps) using a logistic distribution
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
Ps <- plogis(rnorm(n_patients, mean = 2, sd = 1.5))  # Skewed towards higher values

# Simulate survival outcomes based on Ps
survival_outcomes <- rbinom(n_patients, size = 1, prob = Ps)

# Create data frame
data <- data.frame(Ps = Ps, survival = survival_outcomes) |>
dplyr::mutate(death = dplyr::if_else(survival == 1, 0, 1))


```

### The W-Score!

```{r w_score}

# Calculate trauma performance (W, M, Z scores)
trauma_performance(data, Ps_col = Ps, outcome_col = death)

```

## Comparing the Probability of Survival Distribution of your Patient Mix to the [Major Trauma Outcomes Study](https://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/Abstract/1990/11000/The_Major_Trauma_Outcome_Study__Establishing.8.aspx)

The M and Z scores are calculated using methods defined in the [literature](https://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/abstract/1978/10000/a_method_for_comparing_survival_of_burn_patients.3.aspx) may not be meaningful if your the distribution of the probability of survival measure is not similar enough to the Major Trauma Outcomes Study distribution.  {traumar} provides a way to check this in your data analysis script, or even from the console.  The `trauma_performance()` function does this under the hood for you, so you can get a read out of how much confidence you can put into the Z score.

```{r trauma_case_mix}

# Compare the current case mix with the MTOS case mix
trauma_case_mix(data, Ps_col = Ps, outcome_col = death)

```

## The Relative Mortality Metric

[Napoli et al. (2017)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24725579.2017.1325948) published methods for calculating a measure of trauma center (or system) performance while overcoming a problem with the W-Score and the TRISS methodology.  Given that the majority of patients seen at trauma centers will have a probability of survival over 90%, estimating performance based on the W-Score may only indicate how well a center performed with lower acuity patients.  Using Napoli et al. (2017), it is possible to calculate a score that is similar to the W-Score in its interpretability, but deals with the negatively skewed probability of survival problem by creating non-linear bins of score ranges, and then weighting a score based on the nature of those bins.  The Relative Mortality Metric (RMM) has a scale from -1 to 1, where

 * An RMM of 0 indicates that the observed mortality aligns with the expected
 national benchmark across all acuity levels.
 * An RMM greater than 0 indicates better-than-expected performance, where
 the center is outperforming the national benchmark.
 * An RMM less than 0 indicates under-performance, where the centerâ€™s observed
 mortality is higher than the expected benchmark.

The RMM is helpful in that it will be sensitive to higher acuity patients as well, so if a trauma center is struggling to effectively intervene with higher acuity patients, this will be reflected in the RMM.  Conversely, with the W-Score, trauma center performance may not appear to decline due to the influence of the lower acuity patients using the MTOS Distribution.  {traumar} automates the calculation of the RMM as a single score, and by the non-linear binning process recommended by Napoli et al. (2017).

```{r rmm}

# Example usage of the `rmm()` function
rmm(data = data,
    Ps_col = Ps,
    outcome_col = survival)

# Pivoting can be helpful at times
rmm(
  data = data,
  Ps_col = Ps,
  outcome_col = survival,
  pivot = TRUE
)

# RMM calculated by non-linear bin range
# `rm_bin_summary()` function
rm_bin_summary(data = data,
               Ps_col = Ps,
               outcome_col = survival)

```

## There is More!

{traumar} has other functions to help you in your data analysis journey! Check out the additional package documentation at [bemts-hhs/github.io/trauma](https://bemts-hhs/github.io/trauma) where you can find examples of each function the package has to offer.
