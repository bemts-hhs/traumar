\title{SEQIC Indicator 10 – Trauma Team Activation Appropriateness}
\usage{
seqic_indicator_10(
  df,
  level,
  included_levels = c("I", "II", "III", "IV"),
  unique_incident_id,
  trauma_team_activation_level,
  iss,
  nfti,
  groups = NULL,
  calculate_ci = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing trauma incident records.}

\item{level}{Column indicating the trauma center designation level (e.g., I,
II, III, IV).}

\item{included_levels}{Character vector indicating what facility levels to
include in the anlaysis.  Defaults to \code{included_levels}.}

\item{unique_incident_id}{Unique identifier for each record.}

\item{trauma_team_activation_level}{Column indicating the trauma team
activation level (e.g., \code{"Level 1"}, \code{"Level 2"}, \code{"Level 3"},
\code{"Consultation"}). Must be character or factor.}

\item{iss}{Optional numeric column representing the Injury Severity Score.}

\item{nfti}{Optional column indicating Need For Trauma Intervention
classification of positive or negative. Should be character, factor, or
logical.}

\item{groups}{Optional character vector of column names used for grouping
results.}

\item{calculate_ci}{Optional; if not \code{NULL}, must be \code{"wilson"} or
\code{"clopper-pearson"} to compute confidence intervals.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[nemsqar:nemsqa_binomial_confint]{nemsqar::nemsqa_binomial_confint}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{conf.level}}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence
level. Defaults to 0.95 (95\% confidence interval).}
    \item{\code{correct}}{Logical, indicating whether to apply continuity correction for
Wilson intervals. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
  }}
}
\value{
A list of tibbles with counts and proportions for SEQIC Indicators
10a, 10b, and 10c, along with model diagnostics for the Cribari or NFTI
ouputs.  The proportions in 10a, 10b, and 10c will optionally include
confidence intervals grouped by user-specified variables.
}
\description{
Calculates two trauma system quality indicators related to trauma team
activation:
\itemize{
\item 10a: Proportion of patients meeting triage criteria (based on Injury
Severity Score or Need For Trauma Intervention) who received low-level
or no activation (under-triage).
\item 10b: Proportion of patients not meeting triage criteria who received
highest-level trauma activation (over-triage).
\item 10c: Proportion of patients meeting triage criteria (based on Injury
Severity Score or Need For Trauma Intervention) who had a major trauma
(under-triage via Peng & Xiang, 2019).
}

Users may stratify results by one or more grouping variables and optionally
compute confidence intervals.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
\item Restricts analysis to Level I–IV trauma centers.
\item Removes duplicate incidents using \code{unique_incident_id}.
\item Classifies each record as meeting or not meeting triage criteria
based on ISS or NFTI logic.
\item Calculates two quality indicators:
\itemize{
\item 10a: Under-triage — patients who met criteria but received low
activation.
\item 10b: Over-triage — patients who did not meet criteria but
received highest activation.
}
\item Optionally computes binomial confidence intervals for each indicator.
}

Users must ensure appropriate column names are passed and data is
pre-processed to include the necessary fields without missing critical
identifiers or timestamps.
