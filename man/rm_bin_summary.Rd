\usage{
rm_bin_summary(
  data,
  Ps_col,
  outcome_col,
  Divisor1 = 5,
  Divisor2 = 5,
  Threshold_1 = 0.9,
  Threshold_2 = 0.99,
  Z = 1.96
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing the data.}

\item{Ps_col}{The name of the column containing the survival probabilities
(Ps). Should be numeric (values between 0 and 100).}

\item{outcome_col}{The name of the column containing the outcome data. It
should be binary, with values indicating patient survival. A value of `1`
or `TRUE` should represent "alive" (survived), while `0` or `FALSE` should
represent "dead" (did not survive). Ensure the column contains only these
two possible values.}

\item{Divisor1}{A divisor used for binning the survival probabilities
(default is 5).}

\item{Divisor2}{A second divisor used for binning the survival probabilities
(default is 5).}

\item{Threshold_1}{The first threshold for dividing the survival
probabilities (default is 0.9).}

\item{Threshold_2}{The second threshold for dividing the survival
probabilities (default is 0.99).}

\item{Z}{The Z value used for calculating confidence intervals (default is
1.96).}
}
\value{
A tibble containing bin-level statistics including:
  - `bin_number`: The bin to which each patient was assigned.
  - `TA_b`: Total alive in each bin (number of patients who survived).
  - `TD_b`: Total dead in each bin (number of patients who did not survive).
  - `N_b`: Total number of patients in each bin.
  - `EM_b`: Estimated mortality rate for each bin (TD_b / (TA_b + TD_b)).
  - `bin_start`: The lower bound of the survival probability range for each bin.
  - `bin_end`: The upper bound of the survival probability range for each bin.
  - `midpoint`: The midpoint of the bin range (calculated as (bin_start + bin_end) / 2).
  - `R_b`: The width of each bin (bin_end - bin_start).
  - `AntiM_b`: The anticipated mortality for each bin, based on the midpoint.
  - `E_b`: The error bound for the RMM estimate, calculated using the bin size
  and anticipated mortality.
  - `numerator`: The weighted numerator for the RMM calculation.
  - `denominator`: The weighted denominator for the RMM calculation.
  - `RMM`: The Relative Mortality Metric (RMM) for each bin,
  quantifying the difference between observed and expected mortality.
  - `RMM_UL`: The upper 95% confidence limit for RMM.
  - `RMM_LL`: The lower 95% confidence limit for RMM.

\description{
Calculates a bin-level summary for the Relative Mortality Metric (RMM) from
Napoli et al. (2017) by grouping data into bins based on survival
probabilities (Ps) and summarizing outcomes within each bin. This function
returns statistics such as total alive, total dead, estimated mortality,
anticipated mortality, and confidence intervals for each bin.
}
\details{
The Relative Mortality Metric (RMM) quantifies the performance of a center in
comparison to the anticipated mortality based on the TRISS national
benchmark. The RMM measures the difference between observed and expected
mortality, with a range from -1 to 1.

- An RMM of 0 indicates that the observed mortality aligns with the expected
national benchmark across all acuity levels.
- An RMM greater than 0 indicates better-than-expected performance, where
the center is outperforming the national benchmark.
- An RMM less than 0 indicates under-performance, where the center’s observed
mortality is higher than the expected benchmark.

This metric helps assess how a center's mortality compares to the national
standards, guiding quality improvement efforts.

\examples{
# Generate example data with high negative skewness
set.seed(123)

# Parameters
n_patients <- 10000  # Total number of patients

# Generate survival probabilities (Ps) using a logistic distribution
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
Ps <- plogis(rnorm(n_patients, mean = 2, sd = 1.5))  # Skewed towards higher values

# Simulate survival outcomes based on Ps
survival_outcomes <- rbinom(n_patients, size = 1, prob = Ps)

# Create data frame
data <- data.frame(Ps = Ps, survival = survival_outcomes) |>
dplyr::mutate(death = dplyr::if_else(survival == 1, 0, 1))

# Example usage of the `rm_bin_summary` function
rm_bin_summary(data = data, Ps_col = Ps, outcome_col = survival)
