\title{View the Current Patient Population Case Mix Compared to the Major Trauma
Study Case Mix}
\usage{
trauma_case_mix(df, Ps_col, outcome_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing patient data.}

\item{Ps_col}{The name of the column containing the probability of survival
(Ps) values.}

\item{outcome_col}{The name of the column containing the binary outcome data
(e.g., 1 for dead, 0 for alive).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the Ps ranges, the fraction of patients in
  each range in the current population, and the MTOS distribution for each
  range.
}
\description{
This function compares the current patient population's case mix (based on
probability of survival, Ps) to the MTOS case mix by binning patients into
specific Ps ranges. It returns the fraction of patients in each range and
compares it to the MTOS distribution.
}
\details{
The function checks whether the `outcome_col` contains exactly two
unique values representing a binary outcome. It also ensures that `Ps_col`
contains numeric values within the range 0 to 100. If any values exceed 1,
they are converted to decimal format. The patients are then grouped into
predefined Ps ranges, and the function compares the fraction of patients in
each range with the MTOS case mix distribution.
}
\examples{
# Example dataset with 1000 simulated Ps values using rbeta
set.seed(123)  # Setting seed for reproducibility
df <- data.frame(Ps = rbeta(1000, shape1 = 5, shape2 = 1),  # Simulated Ps values
                 outcome = sample(c(1, 0), 1000, replace = TRUE))  # Random outcome (1 or 0)

# Compare the current case mix with the MTOS case mix
trauma_case_mix(df, Ps_col = Ps, outcome_col = outcome)
