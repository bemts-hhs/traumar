\title{View the Current Patient Population Case Mix Compared to the Major Trauma Study Case Mix}
\usage{
trauma_case_mix(df, Ps_col, outcome_col)

trauma_case_mix(df, Ps_col, outcome_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing patient data.}

\item{Ps_col}{The name of the column containing the probability of survival (Ps) values.}

\item{outcome_col}{The name of the column containing the binary outcome data.

The column should contain binary values indicating the patient outcome.
Valid values include 1 (dead) and 0 (alive), or TRUE (dead) and FALSE (alive),
or other similar binary representations (e.g., "Yes" for dead and "No" for alive).
The function will check for two unique values in this column and expects them to represent
the outcome in a binary form.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the Ps ranges, the fraction of patients in each range in the current population,
and the MTOS distribution for each range.

A data frame containing the Ps ranges, the fraction of patients in each range in the current population,
and the MTOS distribution for each range.
}
\description{
This function compares the current patient population's case mix (based on probability of survival, Ps)
to the MTOS case mix by binning patients into specific Ps ranges. It returns the fraction of patients
in each range and compares it to the MTOS distribution.

\details{
The function checks whether the `outcome_col` is binary (i.e., it contains exactly two unique values),
and ensures the `Ps_col` values are numeric and fall within the expected range (0-100). The `Ps_col` is
converted to decimal format if any values exceed 1. It then bins patients into predefined Ps ranges and
compares the fraction of patients in each range to the MTOS case mix distribution.
