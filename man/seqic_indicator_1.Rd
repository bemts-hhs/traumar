\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing trauma incident records.}

\item{trauma_team_activation_level}{Column identifying trauma team activation
level (e.g., Level 1, Level 2).}

\item{trauma_team_physician_service_type}{Column indicating the type of
medical provider (e.g., Surgery/Trauma, Emergency Medicine).}

\item{level}{Column indicating the trauma center designation level (e.g., I,
II, III, IV).}

\item{unique_incident_id}{Unique identifier for each trauma incident.}

\item{response_time}{Numeric variable representing the time (in minutes)
to provider response.}

\item{trauma_team_activation_provider}{Column identifying the responding
provider for trauma activation.}

\item{groups}{Additional columns passed as strings to \code{dplyr::summarize()}
via the \code{.by} argument for grouped summaries.}

\item{calculate_ci}{If \code{NULL}, 95\% confidence intervals will not be
calculated for the performance estimates.  Otherwise, options of "wilson"
or "clopper-pearson" can be supplied to utilize the corresponding methods
to calculate the confidence intervals for the proportions.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[nemsqar:nemsqa_binomial_confint]{nemsqar::nemsqa_binomial_confint}}, \code{\link[nemsqar:nemsqa_binomial_confint]{nemsqar::nemsqa_binomial_confint}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{conf.level}}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence
level. Defaults to 0.95 (95\% confidence interval).}
    \item{\code{correct}}{Logical, indicating whether to apply continuity correction for
Wilson intervals. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
  }}
}
\value{
A tibble summarizing SEQIC Indicator 1 results across sub-measures
(1a–1f). Includes total cases, denominators, and proportions for each
indicator.

This function calculates System Evaluation and Quality Improvement
Committee (SEQIC) Indicator 1 (subparts a through f).
These indicators assess the timeliness and type of provider response (e.g.,
surgeon, midlevel, physician) to trauma alerts based on trauma team
activation level, hospital trauma level, and time to provider presence.
}
\details{
This function filters and summarizes trauma records to calculate
SEQIC Indicators 1a through 1f:
\itemize{
\item 1a: Proportion of Level 1 activations at Level I/II centers with
surgical response ≤ 15 minutes.
\item 1b: Same as 1a, but includes Level III centers and uses ≤ 30 minutes.
\item 1c: Proportion of Level 1 activations with missing surgical response
time.
\item 1d/e: Response within 5 and 20 minutes, respectively, for broader
provider types and activation levels.
\item 1f: Proportion of missing response times among the group in 1d/e.
}

Users must ensure appropriate column names are passed and data is
pre-processed to include the necessary fields without missing critical
identifiers or timestamps. The function will work with a tibble that has one
row per \code{unique_incident_id}.
}
\section{Filters applied include}{

\itemize{
\item Trauma team activation level restricted to "Level 1" or "Level
1" and "Level 2" depending on the indicator.
\item Provider type filtered to surgical and related roles.
\item Trauma verification level filtered to I–IV depending on the measure.
