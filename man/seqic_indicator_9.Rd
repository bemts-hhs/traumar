  level,
  transfer_out_indicator,

\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing trauma incident records.}

\item{level}{Column indicating the trauma center designation level (e.g., I,
II, III, IV).}

\item{transfer_out_indicator}{Unquoted column name indicating whether the
patient was transferred out of the initial trauma center. Logical,
character, or factor type. Values representing "No" (e.g., FALSE, "No")
indicate no transfer out.}

\item{transport_method}{Column identifying the EMS transport method (e.g.,
ambulance, private vehicle). Used to exclude non-qualified modes of
arrival.}

\item{unique_incident_id}{Unique identifier for each record.}

\item{trauma_team_activated}{Column indicating whether the trauma team was
activated (character, factor, or logical).}

\item{ed_decision_LOS}{Numeric column representing minutes from ED arrival to
decision to transfer.}

\item{ed_decision_discharge_LOS}{Numeric column representing minutes from ED
decision to discharge to physical discharge.}

\item{groups}{Additional columns passed as strings to \code{dplyr::summarize()}
via the \code{.by} argument for grouped summaries. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{calculate_ci}{If \code{NULL}, 95\% confidence intervals will not be
calculated for the performance estimates.  Otherwise, options of "wilson"
or "clopper-pearson" can be supplied to utilize the corresponding methods
to calculate the confidence intervals for the proportions. Defaults to
\code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[nemsqar:nemsqa_binomial_confint]{nemsqar::nemsqa_binomial_confint}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{conf.level}}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence
level. Defaults to 0.95 (95\% confidence interval).}
    \item{\code{correct}}{Logical, indicating whether to apply continuity correction for
Wilson intervals. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
  }}
}
\value{
A list of two tibbles:
\itemize{
\item{\code{seqic_9_all}}: Proportion of transferred trauma patients with ED
discharge or decision delays >2 or >3 hours, grouped by optional
variables.
\item{\code{seqic_9_activations}}: Same proportions as above, further stratified
by trauma team activation status.
}

Each tibble includes numerators, denominators, proportions, and (optionally)
confidence intervals for:
\itemize{
\item{9a}: Delayed discharge >2 hours
\item{9b}: Delayed discharge >3 hours
\item{9c}: Delayed decision >1 hours
\item{9d}: Delayed decision >2 hours
\item{9e}: Delayed decision to discharge >1 hour
\item{9f}: Delayed decision to discharge >2 hours
}
}
\description{
Calculates the proportion of EMS-transferred trauma patients who experienced
delayed transfer from the emergency department (ED) based on disposition and
decision-to-transfer timeframes. This includes both overall rates and
stratified results by trauma team activation status, with optional confidence
intervals.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
\item Filters the dataset to include only transfers out from trauma centers
designated Level I through IV.
\item Deduplicates records using \code{unique_incident_id}.
\item Flags records where emergency department decision to discharge
occurred more than 60 or 120 minutes after ED arrival.
\item Flags records where physical departure from the ED occurred more than
120 or 180 minutes after ED arrival.
\item Flags records where physical discharge occurred more than 60 or 120
minutes after ED decision to discharge.
\item Stratifies results by trauma team activation status and
one or more grouping variables.
\item Returns a summarized tibble with the number of delayed cases
(numerator), eligible records (denominator), and the proportion for each
delay threshold.
\item Optionally includes 95\% confidence intervals if \code{calculate_ci = TRUE}.
