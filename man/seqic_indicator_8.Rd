\title{SEQIC Indicator 8 - Survival by Risk Group}
\usage{
seqic_indicator_8(
  df,
  level,
  included_levels = c("I", "II", "III", "IV"),
  unique_incident_id,
  mortality_indicator,
  risk_group,
  groups = NULL,
  calculate_ci = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing trauma incident records.}

\item{level}{Column indicating the trauma center designation level (e.g., I,
II, III, IV).}

\item{included_levels}{Character vector indicating what facility levels to
include in the anlaysis.  Defaults to \code{included_levels}.}

\item{unique_incident_id}{Unique identifier for each record.}

\item{mortality_indicator}{A logical, character, or factor variable
indicating whether the patient died at the trauma center. Accepts values
like \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE} or \code{"Yes"}/\code{"No"}.}

\item{risk_group}{A character or factor column indicating the patient's risk
group (e.g., "High", "Moderate", "Low"). See risk definitions below.}

\item{groups}{Additional columns passed as strings to \code{dplyr::summarize()}
via the \code{.by} argument for grouped summaries. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{calculate_ci}{If \code{NULL}, 95\% confidence intervals will not be
calculated for the performance estimates.  Otherwise, options of "wilson"
or "clopper-pearson" can be supplied to utilize the corresponding methods
to calculate the confidence intervals for the proportions. Defaults to
\code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[nemsqar:nemsqa_binomial_confint]{nemsqar::nemsqa_binomial_confint}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{conf.level}}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence
level. Defaults to 0.95 (95\% confidence interval).}
    \item{\code{correct}}{Logical, indicating whether to apply continuity correction for
Wilson intervals. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
  }}
}
\value{
A named list with two tibbles:

\itemize{
\item{\code{overall}}{
A tibble summarizing overall mortality among trauma patients, grouped by
the variables specified in \code{groups}. Columns include:
\itemize{
\item \code{numerator_8_all}: Number of patients who survived (mortality
indicator was FALSE or "No")
\item \code{denominator_8_all}: Total number of unique trauma incidents
\item \code{seqic_8_all}: Proportion of patients who survived
\item \code{lower_ci_8}, \code{upper_ci_8} (optional): Confidence interval bounds
if \code{calculate_ci} is specified
}
}

\item{\code{risk_group}}{
A tibble summarizing mortality stratified by risk group and any
additional \code{groups} variables. Columns include:
\itemize{
\item \code{{{ risk_group }}}: Risk group variable used for stratification
\item \code{numerator_8_risk}: Number of patients who survived in each risk
group
\item \code{denominator_8_risk}: Total number of unique incidents in each
risk group
\item \code{seqic_8_risk}: Proportion of survivors in each risk group
\item \code{lower_ci_8_risk}, \code{upper_ci_8_risk} (optional): Confidence
interval bounds if \code{calculate_ci} is specified
}
}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the proportion of patients who survived based on risk groups
existing in the data among trauma patients transported to Level I–IV trauma
centers.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Filters the dataset to include only trauma center levels I through
IV.
\item Deduplicates the dataset using \code{unique_incident_id} to ensure one
record per incident.
\item Accepts a mortality indicator that may be logical, character, or
factor, and identifies survivors as those with values of \code{FALSE} or \code{"No"}.
\item Requires a predefined \code{risk_group} variable representing categories
such as "Low", "Moderate", or "High" risk.
\item Calculates overall survival proportions and survival proportions
stratified by risk group.
\item Optionally includes 95\% confidence intervals using binomial methods
if \code{calculate_ci} is specified.
}
}
\note{
This function calculates survival outcomes for patients transported
to trauma centers, stratified by risk of mortality. Risk groups—low,
moderate, and high— are defined by the Iowa System Evaluation and Quality
Improvement Committee (SEQIC) as described below. Users may also apply
alternative risk stratification methods if preferred.

\itemize{
\item Abnormal Physiology Criteria:
\itemize{
\item GCS 3–5
\item Respirations <5 or >30 per minute
\item Systolic BP <60 mm Hg
}
\item Risk Group Definitions:
\itemize{
\item High Risk:
\itemize{
\item Probability of Survival < 0.2, OR
\item ISS > 41, OR
\item ISS > 24 with abnormal physiology
}
\item Moderate Risk:
\itemize{
\item Probability of Survival 0.2–0.5, OR
\item ISS 16–41
}
\item Low Risk:
\itemize{
\item Probability of Survival > 0.5, OR
\item ISS < 16, OR
\item Normal physiology
}
}
}

Users must ensure appropriate column names are passed and data is
pre-processed to include the necessary fields without missing critical
identifiers or timestamps.
