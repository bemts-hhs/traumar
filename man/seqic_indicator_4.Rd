\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing trauma incident records.}

\item{level}{Column indicating the trauma center designation level (e.g., I,
II, III, IV).}

\item{ed_disposition}{Column representing the emergency department
disposition. For a record to be picked up in this function, the ED
dispostion must be documented as "Deceased/Expired".}

\item{ed_LOS}{Column for the calculated ED length of stay, measured in
minutes.}

\item{hospital_disposition}{Column representing the hospital disposition. For
a record to be picked up in this function, the hospital dispostion must be
documented as "Deceased/Expired".}

\item{hospital_LOS}{Column for the calculated hospital length of stay,
measured in minutes.}

\item{unique_incident_id}{Unique identifier for each record.}

\item{autopsy}{Unquoted column name indicating whether an autopsy was
performed. Expected values: \code{"Yes"} or \code{NA}.}

\item{groups}{Additional columns passed as strings to \code{dplyr::summarize()}
via the \code{.by} argument for grouped summaries. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{calculate_ci}{If \code{NULL}, 95\% confidence intervals will not be
calculated for the performance estimates.  Otherwise, options of "wilson"
or "clopper-pearson" can be supplied to utilize the corresponding methods
to calculate the confidence intervals for the proportions. Defaults to
\code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[nemsqar:nemsqa_binomial_confint]{nemsqar::nemsqa_binomial_confint}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{conf.level}}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence
level. Defaults to 0.95 (95\% confidence interval).}
    \item{\code{correct}}{Logical, indicating whether to apply continuity correction for
Wilson intervals. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
  }}
}
\value{
A tibble summarizing SEQIC Indicator 4a and 4b results. Includes
numerator, denominator, and performance rate for the indicator. 95\% confidence
intervals are provided optionally.

Computes SEQIC Indicator 4a and 4b for trauma center performance. Indicator
4a captures the proportion of deceased trauma patients at trauma level I–IV
facilities who had an autopsy performed. Indicator 4b identifies deceased
trauma patients with a prolonged length of stay (LOS > 3 days) but without an
autopsy. Confidence intervals can optionally be calculated for the
proportion, using either the Wilson or Clopper-Pearson method.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
\item Filters trauma records to those with a trauma center level of I–IV.
\item Identifies records where the patient died, based on ED or hospital
disposition.
\item Deduplicates by \code{unique_incident_id} to ensure one record per
incident.
\item For Indicator 4a, calculates the proportion of deceased patients who
received an autopsy.
\item For Indicator 4b, calculates the proportion of deceased patients with
a hospital or ED length of stay greater than 72 hours (4320 minutes) and no
autopsy performed.
}

Users must ensure appropriate column names are passed and data is
pre-processed to include the necessary fields without missing critical
identifiers or timestamps.
