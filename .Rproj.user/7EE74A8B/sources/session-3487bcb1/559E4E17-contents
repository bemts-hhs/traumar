# traumaR: A Toolkit for Trauma and EMS Data Analysis 🚑📊

The `traumaR` package is designed to support meaningful analysis in the trauma and emergency medical services (EMS) domain. It provides robust tools for calculating key metrics, including relative mortality performance trends, W-Scores, and statistical significance measures 🧮 critical for trauma system evaluations 🏥. These metrics help healthcare providers and researchers better understand and compare outcomes in trauma care.

Beyond core functions, `traumaR` includes helper functions that simplify statistical analysis workflows 📈, offering intuitive theming options and streamlined wrappers in R. Where possible, equivalent solutions will also be implemented in Julia 🧑‍💻, catering to users with diverse technical preferences.

While the package is under active development 🚧 and not yet published, I kindly ask that users cite and attribute any use of this package to Nicolas Foss, Ed.D., MS. Your acknowledgment 📜 supports the ongoing development of `traumaR` and its contributions to trauma and EMS research.
