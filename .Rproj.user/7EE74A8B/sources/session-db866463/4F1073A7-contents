# traumar 1.1.0

## New Features

- Added optional grouping functionality to `nonlinear_bins()`, `rmm()`, and `rm_bin_summary()`.  
  - Setting `group_vars = NULL` applies the functions to the entire dataset without subgrouping.  

## Enhancements

- Improved `NA` handling in `rmm()` and `rm_bin_summary()`.  
- Ensured RMM calculations remain within the expected range of [-1 to 1], including their 95% confidence intervals.  
- Optimized `nonlinear_bins()` by replacing its internal `for` loop with `dplyr` functions, enhancing accuracy and efficiency without introducing breaking changes.
