Description: Hospitals, hospital systems, and even trauma systems that provide care to injured patients
    may not be aware of robust metrics that can help gauge the efficacy of their programs in saving the lives
    of injured patients.  This R package provides robust functions driven by the academic literature to 
    automate the calculation of relevant metrics, and provide some helper functions for the data analysis
    journey.
