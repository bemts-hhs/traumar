Description: Hospitals, hospital systems, and even trauma systems that provide care to injured patients
    may not be aware of robust metrics that can help gauge the efficacy of their programs in saving the lives
    of injured patients.  traumar provides robust functions driven by the academic literature to 
    automate the calculation of relevant metrics to individuals desiring to measure the peformance of their
    trauma center or even a trauma system.  traumar also provides some helper functions for the data analysis
    journey. For more information on methods used in this package, please see Napoli et al. (2017)
